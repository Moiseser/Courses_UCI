# Contributing
Any contributions are welcome, if you do not wish to learn git/github just make a document yourself and send it to me (or print it out, or discuss in person).

However..... this is meant to be an interactive project for the class.
Therefore you should do the right thing and go get a git and github account and start developing. 
There is no way for you to 'hurt' the material (I am the dictator and have the final say in all changes that come back to me)... So just get started!

Below I will give a brief introduction to the workflow, with this you shold be able to get started helping on the project in no time. 
The 'software' sid eof the guide will be for Mac OS, if you are running Linux or Windows just google similar instructions, or even better check out the 

## Git / Github
Briefly, these resources provide an interactive environment for people to develop projects together.
This platform has source-control which essentially tracks all changes made to a document (you can look at/revert back to older versions of tehe project).
Clearly the resources are made freely available and can be accessed by anyone.
To contribute to the project you will need a Github (and Git) account.

For a brief tutorial on using and contributing to the resources look in the Chem231B [README](https://github.com/swflynn/Courses_UCI/tree/master/Chem231B_QM).
